## Computational Geometry Algorithm Implementations

### Language: C++

In this repository, you may find the implementations of the following:

* Jarvis March Convex Hull Algorithm
* Kirkseidel Convex Hull Algorithm
* Polygon Triangulation Algorithm

This code was originally written to fulfill coursework requirements and hosted on Bitbucket as part of a private repository. The code in this repo consists of my contribution to a larger project.

All algorithm implementation specific code found in this repository is mine. In the `point.cpp` file, some methods were contributed by my group member, Anushree Hede.
